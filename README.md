# Discord Bot (In Progress)
This is my Discord bot currently in progress, I know there are a lot of good \
ones out there already but I would like to learn how they work through this. :)

# TO DO:
- [ ] Update Giphy cog to support Giphy API.
    - [ ] random gif
    - [ ] trending gif
    - [ ] random gif given a keyword search
- [ ] Find different method to connect to voice channel.
    - [ ] More testing with libopus?
    - [ ] Alternative to being hosted on Heroku

# Notes:
- Appears that libopus cannot be used in junction with Heroku. [Link](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49806427/heroku-deployment-libopus-not-found)
